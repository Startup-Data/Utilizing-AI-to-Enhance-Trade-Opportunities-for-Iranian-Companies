### Steps for Trade Report Preparation
#### 1. Market Analysis with AI
Using AI tools to gather and analyze data on target markets, identifying economic indicators, trade regulations, and consumer preferences.
```python
# Sample Python code to interact with Google Analytics API for market analysis
import google.analytics.data_v1beta as beta
client = beta.BetaAnalyticsDataClient()
request = beta.RunReportRequest()
response = client.run_report(request)
print(response)
```
#### 2. Competitor Analysis
Utilizing AI to assess competitor strengths, weaknesses, and market strategies.
```python
# Sample Python code to analyze competitor data
import requests
url = "https://api.competitoranalysis.com/v1/analyze"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_api_token_here"}
data = {"text": "competitor analysis data"}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```
#### 3. Generating Trade Reports
Structuring the analyzed data into a comprehensive report format suitable for business decision-making.
```python
# Sample Python code to structure trade report
def create_trade_report(data):
    return {
        "market_analysis": data.get("market_analysis"),
        "competitor_analysis": data.get("competitor_analysis"),
        "strategic_recommendations": data.get("recommendations"),
    }
report_data = create_trade_report(analyzed_data)
print(report_data)
```
#### 4. Visualizing Data
Creating visual representations of the data to enhance understanding and impact.
```python
# Sample Python code to create data visualizations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
def visualize_data(data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.plot(data["dates"], data["values"])
    plt.title("Market Trends")
    plt.show()
visualize_data(market_data)
```
